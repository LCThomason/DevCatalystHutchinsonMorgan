READ ME

No font was selected as the default font fits and we feel that a different font would make it hard for others to read. We don't want people to have trouble reading our site. -Hutch

It was fun gathering information, albeit at the last second, on astronomy. I myself have learned quite a lot just by gathering references. -Morgan

Even though our third team member left our party-- I believe we've done a considerable amount of effort into this. -Morgan

Our colors were selected based on what appears easiest to read and what looks decent as well as our theme. Base colors are blacks and whites, the red borders selected pulled from what nebulae could throw as well. The background image was created by myself and I'm proud of how it turned out. The "container theme" style was a reference to some of my Tumblr blogs where I had created the backgrounds on. We may still have to lock the background upon submission, but I promise we will get all small visual errors worked out before or after the contest. -Hutch

Our subject continuously jumpped from one to the other; first a wide range between lititure or art or some local club in school or around town. We soon narrowed it down to a Military Club in school, but later switched to Amateur Astronomers of Jackson to Jackson Tennessee's National information Gathering after our third member left. I will personally fix all signs of previous subjects in the code to make sure everything is consistant to the current subject. -Hutch

Even though the info was fun to do, it was still hard to swollow the fact that I had to comprehend the information in order to put it in my own words.This could've been avoided had we actually done the combination of Military Club and Comic Book Club, but we ultimately had to change it due to artistic restraints. - Morgan

I'm still salty about our third member just leaving on us I won't let it die -Hutch
