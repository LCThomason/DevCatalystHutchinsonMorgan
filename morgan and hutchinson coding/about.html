          <h4>Astronomy Clubs and Organizations
Astronomy is fun, but it can be even more fun when you do it with other people. Sky and Telescope encourages you to contact your local astronomy club, where you'll find like-minded enthusiasts eager to share their knowledge and love of the sky with you. Club meetings offer opportunities to try out new equipment, learn new techniques, and make new friends. They are one of the best resources around for developing your skills and passion for astronomy.
In addition to clubs, you'll find here planetariums, observatories, museums, and other great resources, all of which appear in our directory of clubs and organizations.</h4>
