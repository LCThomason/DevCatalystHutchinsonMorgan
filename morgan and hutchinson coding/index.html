          <h4>Discussion of the Field of Astronomy

<p>Astronomy--the oldest science, with the first observations of the heavens conducted by our early human ancestors. Historical records of astronomical measurements date back as far as Mesopotamia nearly 5000 years ago, with later observations made by the ancient Chinese, Babylonians, and Greeks. We humans seek to explain their world with (internal) models; one of the earliest is that the affairs of humans and the world are controlled by the positions of the stars and planets. Although astrology is now regarded as a psuedo-science, it was the original motivation for the mapping of the stars and the assignment of constellations.</p>
            <p>Astronomy is more than simply a mapping of stars and planets into outlines of gods and magical creatures. It is the scientific study of the contents of entire Univers</p>
            <p>	Scientific observation--like that conducted in astronomy, does not really differ fundamentally from any other kind of observation. One thing we ask is that it is repeatable.  Scientists tend to mistrust single observations on unusual situations (such as UFO sightings). Also, like detectives reconstructing an accident, they tend to mistrust witnesses untrained in proper observation or emotionally involved in what is being described, or both. </p>

<p>Books have been written about what Science really is. Clearly, it has to do with knowledge, and it also has to do with skills. Scientists use their special knowledge and skills to find out about how things and forces work together to make up the world around us. "The world around us" includes everything we can measure or at least perceive, from invisible and elusive particles such as neutrinos (which weigh practically nothing) to clusters of galaxies so large it takes millions of years for light to go from one end to the other. "The world around us" includes Life and its history, the things that make our planet so special and wonderful. And it includes the flow of goods and money, and the way decisions are made by the various levels of government ï¿½ that is, economics and political science. The natural sciences differ from the social sciences in that much of natural science deal with phenomena that can be replicated, in principle, while this is practically never the case for the social sciences. </p></h4>
